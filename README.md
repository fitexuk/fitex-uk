<h3>Key Principles of the Fitex Diet</h3>
<h3>The Fitex Diet operates on several foundational principles to ensure its effectiveness and sustainability:</h3>
<ol start="1" data-spread="true">
<li>
<h3><strong>Focus on Whole Foods</strong></h3>
<ul data-spread="false">
<li>
<h3>Prioritize natural, unprocessed foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, nuts, and seeds. These foods are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber, which support overall health and digestion.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Balanced Macronutrients</strong></h3>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Structured Meal Timing</strong></h3>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Hydration</strong></h3>
<ul data-spread="false">
<li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>Flexibility and Sustainability</strong></h3>
